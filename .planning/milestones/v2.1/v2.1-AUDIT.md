# Milestone Audit: v2.1 Streamlined Deployment

**Audited:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** In Progress
**Reference:** `.planning/ROADMAP.md`

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases | 5 (4 complete, 1 pending) |
| Plans Completed | 9 |
| Gap closures | 0 |
| Technical debt items | 3 major items carried forward |

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Verified | Evidence |
|-------|------|--------|----------|----------|
| 22 | Foundation & Pre-Flight | ✅ Complete | ✅ | `phases/22-foundation-pre-flight/22-VERIFICATION.md` |
| 23 | Prerequisites Installation | ✅ Complete | ✅ | `phases/23-prerequisites-installation/23-VERIFICATION.md` |
| 24 | Interactive Configuration | ✅ Complete | ✅ | `phases/24-interactive-configuration/24-VERIFICATION.md` |
| 25 | Deployment Orchestration | ✅ Complete* | ✅ | `phases/25-deployment-orchestration/25-VERIFICATION.md` |
| 26 | Verification & Completion | 🚧 Pending | - | - |

*Note: Phase 25 is marked Complete in `STATE.md` but "Not started" in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Quality Analysis

### Verification
- All completed phases (22-25) have dedicated `VERIFICATION.md` files.
- Verification methodology relies heavily on "Observable Truths" (code analysis) and unit-level validation.
- **Concern**: Phase 25 verification includes "Human Verification Required" steps (E2E on fresh VM, Resume After Failure) that are not explicitly checked off in the artifact, though the phase is marked passed.

### Technical Debt (Carried Forward)
From `STATE.md`:
1. **AUTH-02**: `@supabase/supabase-js` usage persists in 100+ files.
2. **TTN SDK Integration**: Deferred, blocking 6 hooks.
3. **Data Migration**: Production data migration pending Supabase access.

## Recommendations

1. **Synchronize Roadmap**: Update `ROADMAP.md` to reflect Phase 25 completion.
2. **Execute Phase 26**: Proceed to "Verification & Completion" to likely perform the "Human Verification" steps from Phase 25 as part of the final verification.
3. **Plan for Tech Debt**: Schedule specific cleanup phases for AUTH-02 and TTN SDK in v2.2 or a "Quality" milestone.

## Actions Checklist

- [x] Update `ROADMAP.md` Phase 25 status.
- [x] Create Phase 26 plans.
- [x] Add TODOs for deferred technical debt.
