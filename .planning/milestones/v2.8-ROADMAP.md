# Milestone v2.8: Production Polish

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-30
**Phases:** 49-51
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Fix known production issues discovered during v2.7 deployment verification: useSuperAdmin context error, ServiceWorker uncaught rejection, and WebSocket reconnection flicker.

## Phases

### Phase 49: SuperAdmin Context Fix

**Goal**: Prevent useSuperAdmin from throwing during initial render or when called outside provider
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent fix)
**Requirements**: SA-01, SA-02
**Success Criteria**:

1. `useSuperAdmin` returns a safe default instead of throwing when context is unavailable
2. No `useSuperAdmin must be used within a SuperAdminProvider` error in browser console
3. Components using `useEffectiveIdentity` render without errors on initial page load
4. Existing SuperAdmin functionality (impersonation, platform admin) still works correctly
5. `pnpm run build` succeeds
   **Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 49-01-PLAN.md — Fix useSuperAdmin context error with safe hook variant or error boundary

---

### Phase 50: ServiceWorker Registration Fix

**Goal**: Gracefully handle ServiceWorker registration failure on self-signed SSL certs
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent fix)
**Requirements**: SW-01, SW-02
**Success Criteria**:

1. No uncaught promise rejection from ServiceWorker registration in browser console
2. ServiceWorker registration either succeeds (valid SSL) or fails silently with info log
3. App loads and functions identically with or without ServiceWorker
4. PWA install prompt still works when SSL is valid (future domain setup)
5. `pnpm run build` succeeds
   **Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 50-01-PLAN.md — Add error handling to ServiceWorker registration using virtual:pwa-register/react hook

---

### Phase 51: WebSocket Reconnection Stability

**Goal**: Eliminate Socket.io reconnection flicker caused by JWT token refresh
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent fix)
**Requirements**: WS-01, WS-02, WS-03
**Success Criteria**:

1. Socket.io connection persists through JWT token refresh (no disconnect/reconnect cycle)
2. Socket.io uses WebSocket transport only (no polling fallback/upgrade)
3. No visible "connecting" → "connected" flicker during normal app usage
4. Socket.io still reconnects correctly after actual network disconnection
5. Real-time updates (sensor data, alerts) continue working
   **Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 51-01-PLAN.md — Convert socket auth to callback pattern, eliminate reconnect race condition, add 500ms debounce

## Progress

| Phase                                | Milestone | Plans Complete | Status   | Completed  |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | -------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 49. SuperAdmin Context Fix           | v2.8      | 1/1            | Complete | 2026-01-30 |
| 50. ServiceWorker Registration Fix   | v2.8      | 1/1            | Complete | 2026-01-30 |
| 51. WebSocket Reconnection Stability | v2.8      | 1/1            | Complete | 2026-01-30 |

**v2.8 Total:** 3/3 plans complete (100%)

## Dependency Graph

```
Phase 49 (SuperAdmin Context Fix)     ─┐
Phase 50 (ServiceWorker Registration)  ─┤─ All independent, can run in any order
Phase 51 (WebSocket Stability)         ─┘
```

All phases are independent — no dependencies between them.

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Return safe default from useSuperAdmin instead of throwing (prevents render cascade errors)
- `injectRegister: false` + React hook for ServiceWorker (replaces auto-generated script that lacked error handling)
- Socket.io `auth: (cb) => {...}` callback pattern for JWT on connect/reconnect (replaces imperative `socket.auth = { token }` with race condition)
- 500ms debounce on ConnectionStatus connecting state (suppresses brief visual transitions)

**Issues Resolved:**

- `useSuperAdmin` context error in browser console on page load
- Uncaught promise rejection from ServiceWorker registration on self-signed SSL
- WebSocket disconnect/reconnect flicker during JWT token refresh

**Issues Deferred:**

- None — all v2.8 requirements shipped

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None — all changes are clean fixes
