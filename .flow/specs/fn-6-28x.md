# fn-6-28x Accessibility Enforcement

## Overview

Add automated a11y enforcement. The project has good manual ARIA usage (55+ occurrences of sr-only, aria-label, etc.) and shadcn/ui primitives with built-in a11y, but NO automated enforcement -- no eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, no axe-core, no jest-axe.

## Scope

- Add eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y to ESLint flat config (recommended preset)
- Add @axe-core/react for dev-only runtime auditing
- Add vitest-axe for automated a11y regression testing
- Audit and fix violations found by the new tooling
- Do NOT restructure existing components -- fix violations in place

## Approach

1. Install eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, add recommended config scoped to `*.tsx` files
2. Run lint, triage violations into must-fix vs acceptable
3. Fix critical violations (missing labels, interactive elements without keyboard support)
4. Install @axe-core/react, add dev-only conditional import in main.tsx
5. Install vitest-axe, add a11y smoke test for key pages (Dashboard, Sites, Units, Alerts)
6. Document accepted exceptions in code comments

## Quick commands

- `pnpm lint` (includes a11y rules after setup)
- `pnpm test` (includes a11y smoke tests after setup)

## Acceptance

- [ ] eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y in ESLint flat config with recommended rules
- [ ] Zero critical a11y lint errors (warnings acceptable for incremental fix)
- [ ] @axe-core/react loaded in dev mode only (not in production bundle)
- [ ] At least 4 vitest-axe smoke tests covering main page layouts
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

## References

- Repo scout: 55+ ARIA attributes found across 29 files, but no a11y lint plugin
- Practice scout: Use recommended preset, scope to .tsx files only
- Existing breadcrumb component has proper aria-label, aria-current, sr-only
