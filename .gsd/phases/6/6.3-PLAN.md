# Plan 6.3: Deployment and Final Audit

## Objective

Deploy the updated codebase to production, conduct a final audit of the migration, and monitor the application after deployment.

## Context

- `.gsd/phases/6/6.2-PLAN.md` - Testing and quality assurance completed
- `docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Production deployment guidelines
- `docker/` - Docker configuration files
- `src/` - Frontend React app
- `backend/src/` - Node.js backend

## Tasks
